Abuse includes all forms of physical, sexual, psychological and emotional maltreatment. (Save the Children definition)\n\n❗ **Violence** against children is defined as forms of physical or mental violence, damage and abuse, neglect or neglectful treatment or maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1990,\nArticle 19)\n\n❗ **Child exploitation** refers to using the child for economical or sexual benefit, for gratification or profit, often resulting in unjust, cruel and harmful treatment of the child. (Save the Children definition)\n\n2️⃣ **Know your organisation’s child safeguarding policies and referral procedures.**\n\n📖 All organisations should have or develop child rights safeguarding policies and referral procedures, including details on how to respond appropriately when a parent or child discloses abuse. \n\n📝 You should have accurate knowledge of all protocols and response plans. These will tell you what to do within your organisation if a parent or child reports abuse (e.g. who to report to, internal resources for supporting the child), as well as how to engage outside resources (e.g. local referral pathways, when to engage with authorities). \n\n🔑 It is your responsibility to act regardless of whether you are responding to disclosures of past and/or present abuse. However, you are not responsible for resolving the situation on your own. It is important that you discuss the situation with your supervisor to agree on what steps to take next.\n\n3️⃣ **Ensure parents know that you are someone who can help.**\n\n🌷Parents participating in your sessions need to know that they can come to you for help, regardless of when abuse occurred. \n\n👂You should make sure that they know that they can trust you and that you will listen and support them without judgement or any further harm.",

You can remind them that this will make it more likely that their child will follow the rule and will also help their child learn responsibilities.\n\nHere are some common challenges and possible solutions for setting household rules and routines. \n\nYou can share the following messages as responses during your weekly chat when parents share challenges with this topic."
